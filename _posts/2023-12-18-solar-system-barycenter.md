When thinking about solar system we usually imagine the planets orbiting the Sun, but in reality,
every object in the solar system, including the Sun, orbits a moving point called the solar system
[*barycenter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter_(astronomy)).
A barycenter is simply the center of mass of any orbital system.
It is usually close to the most massive body and in planetary systems it is often inside the stellar radius.
In binary systems the barycenter is always located between the centers of the two objects, like in this 
animation of the Earth-Moon system:

Earth is so much more massive than the Moon that the Earth-Moon barycenter is within the Earth, but 
barycenters of other binary systems it may be between the two objects. For example, the Pluto-Charon
barycenter is well outside Pluto's radius, about 10% of the way to Charon.

In the case of our solar system, the barycenter is almost always less than 2 solar radii from the center
of the Sun, but its precise location moves quite a bit depending where the planets are in their orbits.

Below is an animation of the solar system barycenter (the red "x") between 1950 and 2050.
The black circle marks the outer boundar of the Sun and the colorful arrows point in the direction of 
each of the the four giant planets.
When the four giant planets are all on the same side the barycenter is pulled far beyond the solar radius,
and when they are all pulling in different directions the barycenter falls close to the center of the Sun.

This figure shows the position of the barycenter with respect to the Sun between 1800 and 2200, with 
the distance from the center of the Sun plotted at the bottom.
According to these calculations by JPL's [Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/), the solar system barycenter spends about 62% of its time outside the Sun's radius about and nearly 3% of its time beyond two solar radii.
It rarely ventures close to the center of the Sun.
