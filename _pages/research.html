    Early during Titan's southern fall, images captured by Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem revealed the formation of a large cloud above Titan's south pole. Subsequent analysis of Cassini data revealed the cloud contained HCN ice, but the cloud's evolution has not been examined. We reviewed imagery of Titan's south pole between 2012 and the end of mission at L<sub>s</sub> = 93°. We find evidence of cloud formation as early as L<sub>s</sub> = 32° (April 2012), one terrestrial month earlier than previously reported, after which the cloud persists until L<sub>s</sub> = 79° (mid 2016). The cloud top altitude descended from about 320 km at L<sub>s</sub> = 32° to below 230 km by L<sub>s</sub> = 79°, at which point it became obscured by atmospheric methane absorption. The cloud also grew laterally, remaining just beyond the terminator, suggesting the cloud marks a region of cold air in the polar stratosphere. These measurements place new constraints on Titan's polar stratospheric temperature structure and circulation during southern fall.

    Ice clouds in Titan's polar
  stratosphere are implicated in radiative heating and cooling and in
  transporting volatile organic compounds from where they form in the
  upper atmosphere to the surface of the moon. In early southern fall,
  Cassini detected a large, unexpected cloud at an altitude of 300 km
  over Titan's south pole. The cloud, which was found to contain HCN
  ice, was inconsistent with the most recent measurements of
  temperature in the same location and suggested that the atmosphere
  had to be 100 K cooler than expected. However, changes to Cassini's
  orbit shortly after the cloud's appearance precluded further
  observations, and, consequently, the atmospheric conditions and the
  details of the formation and evolution of the cloud remain
  unknown. We address this gap in the observational record by using
  microphysical cloud modeling to estimate the parameter space
  consistent with published measurements. Based on the nearest
  available temperature profile retrievals and other observations, we
  hypothesize that the cloud forms around 300 km and then descends
  until it reaches the cold lower stratosphere by late southern
  fall. The observations can be simulated using a cloud microphysical
  model by introducing a descending cold layer with temperatures near
  100 K. In simulations of this scenario, the precipitation from this
  cloud rapidly removes over 70% of the HCN vapor from the
  stratosphere. This result suggests that vapor descending into the
  polar stratosphere during early fall is mostly removed from the
  stratosphere before the onset of winter and does not circulate to
    lower latitudes.
